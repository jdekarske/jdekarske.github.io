## Currently

`Jan 2020-`
__UC Davis__  
*Graduate Student Researcher*

As humans wade further from Earth, we must develop technologies to support our survival. The Habitats Optimized for Missions of Exploration (HOME) research institute develops a basic understanding of how habitats interact with humans using mixed autonomy. Robotic systems must collaborate with humans when necessary and maintain themselves when humans are away. I'm studying high-level robotic decision-making in collaborative tasks. See the Education section below for more information about my research.

## Professional Training

`May 2023-Aug 2023`
__NASA Science Mission Design School__  
*Planetary Science Summer School*

With a team of early career scientists and engineers, I developed a conceptual mission to Neptune's moon, Triton. Planetary Science Summer School is an 11-week program including rigorous preparation for a final week of concurrent mission design with NASA Jet Propulsion Lab's Team-X. In this experience, I served as Project Manager and organized teamwork, mission requirements, and spacecraft capabilities. Our mission aimed to characterize the subsurface ocean of Triton, the enigmatic surface plumes, and unique cantaloupe terrain. The posters we presented at AGU 2023 can be found on my website.

`October 2020`
__International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling__  
*Tutorial on Epistemic Planning and Summer School on Automated Planning & Scheduling*

I had the opportunity to learn planning fundamentals like PDDL, Solvers, Execution Monitoring, and Robotics.

## Experience

In addition to the professional experience listed below, you can find my infinitely expanding hobby, Open Source, and self-teaching projects on [Github](https://github.com/jdekarske/). I have a habit of dreaming about an end product and learning the skills needed to produce it, whether or not those skills are in my wheelhouse. So I'm hoping that the software I share can improve community-driven projects and that snippets of thoughts can help other learners.

`Aug 2021-June 2022`
__NASA Ames Research Center__  
*Intern Intelligent Robotics Group*

Distant robotic systems operate under significant time delay, posing teleoperation challenges for earthly operators. Predictive systems could fill the temporal void between commands sent to a robotic system. Still, proposed techniques rely on precisely modeled systems. In this project, I'm studying the performance of a human-[astrobee](https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee) team operating under time delay with an idealized predictive system.
